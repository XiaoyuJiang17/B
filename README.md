# MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction Using Deep Learning/ Summer Project
1. Data processingï¼š we are given four kinds of data for data pretreatment for further analysis. We referred to some data processing methods in the literature and  used the kernel method to synthesize the known information and generated martrices DATA_M, DATA_D and DATA_MD2 to describe the similarity of miRNA, disease and their correlation. Further, these data are used to construct new feature vectors.
