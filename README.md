# MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction Using Deep Learning/ Summer Project
1. Data processing： we are given four kinds of data for data pretreatment for further analysis. We referred to some data processing methods in the literature and  used the kernel method to synthesize the known information and generated martrices DATA_M, DATA_D and DATA_MD2 to describe the similarity of miRNA, disease and their correlation. Further, these data are used to construct new feature vectors.
2. Literature review. We read many models proposed by other researchers, such as DRMDA, WBSMDA, VAEMDA etc. Their model is reproduced according to the ideas stated in their papers
3. Model construction and training. After extensive reading of relevant literature, we proposed and implemented a model based on BiGAN（Bi-directional Generative Adversarial Network）
